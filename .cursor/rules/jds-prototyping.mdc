# JDS Prototyping Rules

BEFORE writing any UI code, you MUST:
1. Call the `get_assets` MCP tool to get asset file paths
2. Copy fonts, icons, and animations into the project

## STRICT RULES — violations will break the design system

### NO EMOJIS
- NEVER use emojis (🔍 ❤️ ⚡ etc.) anywhere in the UI
- Use JDS icon components from assets/icons/ instead (e.g. IcSearch, IcChat, IcMic)

### NO SYSTEM FONTS
- NEVER use Inter, Arial, Helvetica, Roboto, SF Pro, sans-serif, or any system font
- ALWAYS load and use JioType from assets/fonts/
- Add @font-face declarations pointing to assets/fonts/woff2/ or assets/fonts/ttf/

### NO HARDCODED VALUES
- NEVER hardcode colors, spacing, or typography values
- Call `resolve_token` MCP tool to get the correct JDS token values
- Call `lookup_component` MCP tool before implementing any component

### NO PLACEHOLDER ASSETS
- NEVER use placeholder images, dummy icons, or fake animations
- Use real assets from the `get_assets` MCP tool response
- Use HelloJio animations from assets/animations/ for AI/assistant states
